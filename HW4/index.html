<h2>The Snob Money Grabber</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
As a snob, you mush collect as much money as you can so it does not go to other people.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Snob was the theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The money spawn is random in terms of where on the y axis it appears but the spawning is timed. The inpt is via mouse, you just need to click the money to get points. This is a collector game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    I am testing spawning sprites from a group and removing them and learning timers
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I have a timer (found an example since the api for phaser isnt that clear) and i hvae a group, the money, that spawns at intervals and kill them selves either on click or when they're out of bounds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Not much setting needed. You are a rich snob who loves money. The setting is at a charity event that you get roped into going to. As a money grubbing snob, you want to steal as much as you can when a whirlwind comes by and sweeps money up into the air.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The story: there was a whirlwind at a charity event and as a snob, you want to take all the money for yourself. You have 5 minutes to do so before anyone notices.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Targer audience is anyone who likes clicking their mouse.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5 Minutes long
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
CLICK AS FAST AS YOU CAN
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Menu screen: self-made</li>
<li>Button image: self-made</li>
<li>Money Image: first thing that came up from google: searched "dollar bill" and set the size to icon</li>
<li>Snob Image: First thing that came up from google</li>
<li>Music: "For the love of money" The O'Jays</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game is close to other games that have clickable environments and are time limited.
Phaser Timer example i found that doesn't look bad and actually explains how to use the phaser timer
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/10121-count-down-timer/">Phaser Timer</a></li>
