<h2>Book Jeopardy</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This prototype game is a board game where you have to get to the end of the track without crashing. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used car crash for my theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experience the thrill of a drag race in a board game. (hahahahahahahaha)
But really though, i want players to experience fustration, the future revision will be much much harder. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game play is simple, the players roll to see how far they go. Unfortunatly, i did not get multiple players set up in time and there are a bunch of other things not implemented. In the revision i will have spaces that hurt the player as well as inteactions with other players (cars) when on the same track. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I am prototyping board game mechanics
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It's a straightforward game, not much to say yet as it is a prototype. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is set in a car topia where everyone drag races. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No story
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Board game players
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
    Not long.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    Currently, not enough is implemented for strategies to be effective.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
