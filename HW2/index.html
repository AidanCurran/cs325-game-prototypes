<h2>Asteroid dodger</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
My game is a simple dodging game. Dodge all the asteroids to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the asteroid theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is very random. The asteroids all spawn in a random location so it can make the game difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to be frustrated with the rng but aslo to enjoy the overall game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay is essentially a stick figure moving back and forth. The player can use the left and right arrow keys as inputs.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Digital prototyping
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game is pretty simple so far, i would say its set apart from other games due to the difficulty, it can be really easy or very difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is all abstract. It takes place on a alternate version of earth that sees lots of asteroid showers that just so happen to not destroy the earth somehow. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
My game doesn't have a complling story per-say, it's mainly about a guy who lives alone and like to dodge asteroids. Since is the one passtime he has he's pretty good at it. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone that like dodging games and has a few minutes to spare
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or two
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The game is all rng so there's no real strategy
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>All the images used were created by me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed bits and pieces from the different phaser examples. I had a hard time getting things to work without breaking. There was an example for a moving ufo which i got the movement from, i learned how to display text, create a group and collision.
